# Georaphic_Python
programs that deal with georaphic data
So this is a programm that aggregate georgahic data from different files in 1 Excel table. I used MultiIndex method that make output very 
simple and beautifull. In this work i used only 51 input files but you can change code for as much files as you want :)
